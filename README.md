## Crash Data Application (crash-app)
This shiny application compares and summarizes data regarding fatal car crashes within the United States during the year 2012 (2009 for ‘Speeding’ data). The visualizations show how respective states’ drivers statistically compare in the frequency of dangerous behaviors coinciding with fatal car crashes and could potentially be used by state authorities to know how to target traffic patrol efforts.

A comparison feature is also available (for all metrics except reference group ‘Fatalities’) to illustrate the subset of total fatalities for each state that were also associated with a particular dangerous behavior. The 'Data Table' tab provides the percentage and/or number of fatalities. Both the graphic and the data table may be sorted in descending order to draw attention to the highest risk states.
